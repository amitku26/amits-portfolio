            I’m a final-year B.Tech (CSE) student with a strong foundation in
            full-stack web development, passionate about turning ideas into
            scalable, high-performing digital products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past year, I’ve built Mern real-time chat applications, social media and
            video streaming projects.

            My tech stack includes React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Socket.IO,
            Firebase, and modern tools like Redux Toolkit, Vite, and Appwrite. I
            focus on writing clean, maintainable code and delivering smooth user
            experiences. When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new JavaScript
            libraries, contributing to open-source projects, and keeping up with
            the latest trends in web technologies.
